    Intro. In mid-March 2020, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions. Number of flights per day from Canadian airlines dropped from ~900 to ~200.<br><br>

    Sources. Canadian Airlines were pulled from Wikipedia's page: "List of airlines of Canada" [1]. Aircrafts' owner were taken from OpenSky Network's datasets [2]. Daily flights were pulled from OpenSky Network's API [3]. All flights where first seen is between March 1, 2020 12:00:00 AM GMT and March 31, 2020 11:59:59 PM GMT. Airport coordinates were extracted from OurAirports [4]<br><br>

    Methodology. From the list of Canadian airlines, we only use airlines with a known callsign (32). Then we can filter the aircrafts owned by Canadian airlines from the aircraft database (1014). Data for each aircraft was queried individually from the API - there may have discrepancies given the number of request. Flights with unknown arrival or departure airport were removed. Flights with same arrival and departure airport were removed as well. After cleansing, we end up with 21,608 flights from 497 aircrafts.<br><br>

    Tech. Data analysis was done on Python with pandas. Data is stored in SQLite, and exported as a JSON file. D3 Javascript library was used to visualize globe. Lots of code from Mike Bostock 2011 <a href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/azimuthal.html" class="a-discrete" target="_blank">talk</a> and Derek Watkins' <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4686432" class="a-discrete" target="_blank">globe</a>. <a href="https://github.com/johnwalley/d3-simple-slider" class="a-discrete" target="_blank">d3-simple-slider</a> for slider. <a href="https://picnicss.com/" class="a-discrete" target="_blank">Picnic CSS</a> was used for style.<br><br>
